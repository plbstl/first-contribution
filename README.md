Automatically respond to a user's first issue or pull request in your repository.

## Usage

You can respond to first-time contributors when they open new issues and pull requests. You can also respond when those
opened issues and pull requests are closed.

- All inputs are optional.
- All inputs have no default values (except for `token` which defaults to `{{ github.token }}`).
- If the relevant message is empty, no comment will be made.
- If no labels are provided, the issue or pull request labels will remain untouched.

### Notes

- You can reuse messages by passing the input parameter name instead. See the [Detailed example](#detailed) for more information.
- Labels are only added to new issues and pull requests.

### Inputs ðŸ“¥

    # The GitHub access token (e.g. secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN)
    # used to add relevant comments and labels.
    # This defaults to {{ github.token }}.
    token: ${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
