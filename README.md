Automatically respond to a user's first issue or pull request in your repository.

- **Flexible Tracking**: Greet users on their first issue and first pull request separately, or just once on their very
  first interaction.
- **Custom Messages**: Define unique messages for different events like opening an issue, merging a PR, or closing a
  contribution.
- **Automatic Labeling**: Apply labels to issues and PRs from new contributors to help with triage.
- **Placeholder Support**: Use `{fc-author}` in any message to mention the contributor by their GitHub username.
- **Message Reuse**: Avoid repetition by reusing message content from other inputs.

## Usage

You can respond to first-time contributors when they open new issues and pull requests, and you can also respond when
those contributions are closed.

- All inputs are optional.
- If a message input (e.g., `issue-opened-msg`) is not provided, no comment will be made for that event.
- If no label inputs are provided, the issue or pull request labels will remain untouched.
- You can use `{fc-author}` in any of the `-msg` inputs to reference the issue or pull request author's username.
- You can reuse messages by passing another message input's name as the value. See the
  [Detailed example](#detailed-configuration) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `labels` inputs (`labels`, `issue-labels`, and `pr-labels`) are only applied when an issue or pull request is
> opened. They do not apply to `closed` events.

<!--  -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure your workflow is configured to listen to the necessary events and has been granted the required
> `permissions` for the action to function correctly. See the [examples below](#examples).

### Welcome First-Time Contributors (Issues & PRs)

Welcome users when they open their first issue and their first pull request. Also, add a label to each.

```yaml
name: Welcome First-Time Contributor

on:
  issues:
    types: opened
  pull_request_target:
    types: opened

jobs:
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          labels: first-contribution
          issue-opened-msg: |
            ### Hey @{fc-author}! :wave:
            Thanks for opening your first issue in this project! Welcome to the community. :heart:
          pr-opened-msg: |
            ### Hey @{fc-author}! :tada:
            Thanks for opening your first pull request! We appreciate your contribution.
```

### Welcome a Contributor Only Once

Use `contribution-mode: once` to welcome a user only on their absolute first interaction, whether it's an issue or a PR.

```yaml
name: Welcome a Contributor (Once)

on:
  issues:
    types: opened
  pull_request_target:
    types: opened

jobs:
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          contribution-mode: once
          issue-opened-msg: >
            Welcome @{fc-author}! Thanks for your first contribution to our project. We're excited to have you here!
            :heart:
          # Reuse the same message for PRs for a consistent welcome
          pr-opened-msg: issue-opened-msg
```

### Add New Contributor After Merge

Add a new contributor after their first PR is merged, using the
[@all-contributors bot](https://github.com/apps/allcontributors).

```yaml
name: Add New Contributor

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: closed

jobs:
  add-contributor:
    # This job only runs for merged PRs
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          pr-merged-msg: >
            @all-contributors please add @{fc-author} for ${{ join(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, ', ') }}
```

### Detailed Configuration

- Add different labels for first-time issues and PRs.
- Comment on opened and closed events.
- Reuse message text across different inputs.

```yaml
name: Detailed First Contribution Flow

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed]
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, closed]

jobs:
  process-contribution:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          issue-labels: first-issue, needs-triage
          pr-labels: first-pr, needs-review

          # Reuse message text by referencing the input parameter name.
          pr-opened-msg: issue-opened-msg
          pr-merged-msg: issue-completed-msg
          pr-closed-msg: issue-not-planned-msg
