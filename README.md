> A GitHub Action to automatically welcome and encourage first-time contributors.

- **Flexible Tracking**: Greet users on their first issue and first pull request separately, or just once on their very
  first interaction.
- **Custom Messages**: Define unique messages for different events like opening an issue, merging a PR, or closing a
  contribution.
- **Message Reuse**: Avoid repetition by reusing message content from other inputs.
- **Placeholder Support**: Use `{fc-author}` in any message to mention the contributor by their GitHub username.
- **Automatic Labeling**: Apply labels to issues and PRs from new contributors to help with triage.
- **Automatic Emoji Reactions**: Add one or more emoji reactions to the contributor's issue or pull request.
- **Smart Contributor Detection**: Avoids misidentifying existing repository committers as new by checking their commit
  history in addition to their issue and pull request activity.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Add the following workflow to `.github/workflows/welcome.yml`:

```yaml
name: Welcome First-Time Contributor

on:
  issues:
    types: opened
  pull_request_target:
    types: opened

permissions: {}

jobs:
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write # Required to post comments and labels on issues
      pull-requests: write # Required to post comments and labels on PRs
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          labels: first-contribution
          issue-opened-msg: |
            ### Hey @{fc-author}! :wave:

            Thanks for opening your first issue. Welcome to the community! :heart:
          pr-opened-msg: |
            ### Hey @{fc-author}! :tada:

            Thanks for opening your first pull request. We really appreciate it.
```

That‚Äôs it. Your repository will now automatically greet newcomers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Your workflow **must** have the correct `permissions` for the action to post comments, labels, and reactions.

### Add Reactions to a First Contribution

    types: opened

permissions: {}

jobs:
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          issue-opened-msg: Welcome, @{fc-author}! Thanks for opening your first issue.
          pr-opened-msg: Thanks for your first PR, @{fc-author}!
          issue-reactions: eyes
          pr-reactions: +1, rocket
```

### Welcome a Contributor Only Once

Use `contribution-mode: once` to greet a user only on their absolute first interaction, whether it's an issue or a PR.

name: Welcome a Contributor (Once)

  issues:
    types: opened
  pull_request_target:

            Welcome @{fc-author}! Thanks for your first contribution to our project. We're excited to have you here!
            :heart:
          # Reuse the same message for PRs for a consistent welcome
          pr-opened-msg: issue-opened-msg
```

### Add New Contributor After Merge

Add a new contributor after their first PR is merged using the
[@all-contributors bot](https://github.com/apps/allcontributors).

```yaml
name: Add New Contributor

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: closed

permissions: {}

jobs:
  add-contributor:
    # This job only runs for merged PRs
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: plbstl/first-contribution@v4
        with:
          pr-merged-msg: >
            @all-contributors please add @{fc-author} for ${{ join(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, ', ') }}

## üîê Security

This action is designed to be safe. It uses the `pull_request_target` event to gain the necessary permissions to comment
on pull requests from forks.

The security risk with `pull_request_target` only arises if you check out and run untrusted code from the pull request.
This action **never** does that; it only uses trusted metadata from the event to function.

**TL;DR:** Never use `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` in a checkout step within a `pull_request_target`
workflow.

‚úÖ **Safe:** Checking out your own trusted code.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v5 # Checks out your default branch
```

‚ùå **Unsafe:** Checking out untrusted code from the PR.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v5
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} # DANGEROUS
```
